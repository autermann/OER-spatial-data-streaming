This repository contains all materials that are used to build an publish an Open Educational Resource (OER) about processing streams of spatial data. The OER module provides a) some background on IoT and stream processing and b) a technical tutorial on how to use Kafka and Jupyter Notebooks (Python) to access and analyze data streams coming from IoT devices that provide air quality data (e.g. PM2.5 sensor data). 

### Content:
* Chapter 1: Overview
* Chapter 2: Background on the Internet of Things (IoT), processing of data streams and on Particulate Matter (PM2.5) as an air quality parameter
* Chapter 3: Technical tutorial on the installation and use of Kafka and Jupyter notebooks to manage and process PM2.5 data streams
* Chapter 4: Wrap up and self tests

The OER is designed to be used by students and professionals who want to improve their skills in developing applications for near-real-time data. You should have some basic knowledge of Python and it wouldn't be bad if you already have some experience with Docker and Jupyter notebooks too. But don't worry, we will guide you through all those technologies and you can also use the tutorial to get your first hands-on experience with it. 

### How to use the OER Module

The OER module is implemented as an  [H5P](https://h5p.org/) module that can be downloaded and integrated into any H5P runtime environment, such as: 
- Learning management systems based on Moodle or Ilias 
- H5P editing environments such as the [H5P Official Editor](https://h5p.org/) or the lightweight [LUMI H5P editor](https://lumi.education/)
- Content managament systems such as [Wordpress](https://wordpress.com/) Install the "H5P" Plugin
Simply upload the H5P file to one of those environments and use it from there...

### Authors and funding

This OER module has been developed at the Institute for Geoinformatics, University of MÃ¼nster. Authors are Jaskaran Puri (main idea, technical tutorial) with contributions from Sandhya Rajendran, Thomas Kujawa and Albert Remke.

The OER4SDI project has been recommended by the Digital University NRW and is funded by the Ministry of Culture and Science NRW.
