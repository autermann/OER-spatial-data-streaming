This repository contains all the materials used to create and publish an Open Educational Resource (OER) on processing spatial data streams. The OER module provides a) some background information on IoT and stream processing and b) technical guidance on how to use Kafka and Jupyter Notebooks (Python) to access and analyse data streams coming from IoT devices providing air quality data (e.g. PM2.5 sensor data). 

### Content:
* Chapter 1: Overview
* Chapter 2: Background on the Internet of Things (IoT), processing of data streams and on Particulate Matter (PM2.5) as an air quality parameter
* Chapter 3: Technical tutorial on the installation and use of Kafka and Jupyter notebooks to manage and process PM2.5 data streams
* Chapter 4: Wrap up and self tests

The OER is designed for students and professionals who want to improve their skills in developing applications for near-real-time data. Users should have some basic knowledge of Python and it would not be bad to have some experience with Docker and Jupyter notebooks as well. However, the OER guides you through all these technologies and can also be used to gain some initial practical experience with them. 

### How to use the OER Module

The OER module is implemented as an  [H5P](https://h5p.org/) module that can be downloaded and integrated into any H5P runtime environment, such as: 
- Learning management systems based on Moodle or Ilias 
- H5P editing environments such as the [H5P Official Editor](https://h5p.org/) or the lightweight [LUMI H5P editor](https://lumi.education/)
- Content managament systems such as [Wordpress](https://wordpress.com/) with "H5P" plugin installed
Simply upload the H5P file to one of those environments and use it from there...

### Authors and funding

This OER module has been developed at the Institute for Geoinformatics, University of MÃ¼nster. Authors are Jaskaran Puri (main idea, technical tutorial) with contributions from Sandhya Rajendran, Thomas Kujawa and Albert Remke.

The OER4SDI project has been recommended by the Digital University NRW and is funded by the Ministry of Culture and Science NRW.
